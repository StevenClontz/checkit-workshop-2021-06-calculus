## Progress
- [ ] Picture problem, (including defining continuity)
- [x] Where is it continuous? or where not? with sin or cos in bottom
- [x] Where is it not continuous? with rational function, removable or not?
- [ ] Ask something involving Interval Notation?  What we currently have doesn't seem to fully address the Outcome
- [ ] Ask where a piecewise-defined function is continuous?

## Not Done
- Problem 1 (pictures needed!)
- generalize Problem 3 to other rational functions... right now it's always quadratic over quadratic, one removable discontinuity and one not removable.  Could do higher degree if we gave it to them factored.  Maybe just denominator factored?  Still make them factor the quadratic numerator?  Or if we multiplied denominator by x^n.
