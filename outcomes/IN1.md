Use geometric formulas to find definite integrals.

- Use geometric formulas for area to compute the following definite
  integrals.
  
    1. $\int_2^4\sqrt{4-(x-2)^2}\,dx$
    2. $\int_1^4 (6-2x)\,dx$
    2. $\int_{-5}^{-2} (-3x)\,dx$
    
    

Goals: 
  - Semi-circle (all or half, positive or negative)   
  - Triangle with absolute value

On June 8, Hannah Burson and Jean-SÃ©bastien Turcotte implemented a three part question with one semi or quarter circle, one triangle, and one difference between two triangle areas. We used the same function twice to reduce the amount of time students should spend graphing.
