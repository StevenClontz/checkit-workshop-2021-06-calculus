## Ideas
- one plug and chug
- one factor/reduce
- choose one from rationalize or common denominator

## Progress

- [x] Indeterminate (factor and cancel version)
- [x] Plug and chug limit
- [x] Rationalize
- [x] Common denominator
- [x] List of problems/answers to loop through

## Not Done
- Trig limits: sinx/x type problems
- Plug and chug trig limits
- any transcendentals
