The first two problems are not related to this student learning outcome. They might still be of value with a different outcome. Should we drop the telescoping part?

Should this be a learning outcome about finding the sequence of partial sums and itself has a closed form (to lead up to the next standard)?

What about: Make this one about geometric converging to sequence of partial sums, finding the closed form, and taking limits. No summation notation involved, though.  And then delete SQ4 and put into another one.

## SQ Standards

 - SQ1. Define and use explicit and recursive formulas for sequences.

 - SQ2. Determine if a sequence is convergent, divergent, monotonic, or bounded, and compute limits of convergent sequences.
 
 - SQ3. (PARTIAL SUM SEQUENCE) Convert a (telescoping) sequence into its partial sum sequence, and find its limit.
 
 Convert (telescoping and geometric) sequences into sequences of partial sums, and find the closed form of the partial sum sequence.
 
 - SQ4. Determine convergence and values of geometric summations.
 
 - SQ5. Use Divergence, Alternating Summation, and Integral Tests to determine convergence of summations.
 
 - SQ6. Direct and Limit Comparison Tests to determine convergence of summations.
 
 - SQ7. Use Ratio and Root Tests to determine convergence of summations.
 
 - SQ8. Determine absolute and conditional convergence of summations.
 
 - SQ9. Identify appropriate convergence tests for various summations.
