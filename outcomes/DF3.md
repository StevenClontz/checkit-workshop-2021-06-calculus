EDIT: Abby Noble - Considerations needed here (and throughout the outcomes) about if we are producing for early or late transcendentals courses (or accounting for both). My department is currently late transcendentals, though may be shifting soon.



6/8/21 - CheckIt Workshop -

Focusing on Early Transcendentals.

3 problems - 
- 1 polynomial 
- 1 with exponent rearranging 
- 1 with trig and/or transcendental

Do we want to insist that a and b in x^(a/b) are relatively prime? It might be nice to have them recognize that they may be able to simplify first. The second one will not be trivial. 

Fixed display for exponent problem to override sage preferences.

Trig and transcendental derivative displays with common denominator.
