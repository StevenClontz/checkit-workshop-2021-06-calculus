Use the Extreme Value Theorem to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a closed interval.

MS: multiple versions a la the demo example with slope of a line where sometimes the abs max/min are endpoints and sometimes at least one of the max/min is inside the interval?

MS: part a and part b with one as a degree 3 polynomial and one as a thing to a fractional power (note to self: work backwards; set the max/min first, then build the function to match)

MS: maybe this needs to be broken up into multiple problems? as it is, the difficulty can vary based on the locations of the critical points with respect to the interval?
