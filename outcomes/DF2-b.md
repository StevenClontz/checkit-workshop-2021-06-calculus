Use derivative notation correctly, estimate the value of a derivative using difference quotients, and draw corresponding secant and tangent lines on the graph of a function.

Problem 1- 

Problem 2- Skipped because CheckIt does not currently support graphics

Problem 3- Several possible ideas. Given values for g(2) and g(2.3), approximate g'(2); given some function, compute values at like f(1) and f(1.1) and approximate f'(1)

(We could think about splitting up this learning target into two or three: notation; tangent lines and secant lines; and compute difference quotients to estimate derivatives)

Other idea on 
for the line tangent to the graph of f(x) at (3,2) passes through (-1,1). Find
a) f(3)
b) f'(3)
c) the equation of the tangent line
