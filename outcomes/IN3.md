### June 8:

Hannah Burson, Laura Kinnel, Jean-Sebastien Turcotte, and Sarah Nelson worked on the check it implementation.

We wrote 4 parts: a polynomial, an exponential, a trig function, and a root function. Ideally, we would like the root to show as a root instead of a power, but we don't know how to do that with sage.

We discussed reducing it to three parts and decided against it, but instructors have options for editing:
  - add a term with a root to the polynomial 
  - choose between the exponential/(1/x) function and the trig function.
