## Progress
[x] one rational, both of degree no more than 2

[x] one involves a possibly fractional alternating addend

[x] one involves an exponential that could appear in the numerator or denominator. 

[ ] more kinds of sequences?  geometric? ones that involve sin (n/2 pi) or cos (npi)?  Still chose three from all these options?

## Notes or Further work
- There is no restriction on whether/how many of the three parts converge or diverge. 
- We purposely left instructions about limits off, as that seems to be part of understanding convergence/divergence, and is most general for whatever different instructors might accept as justification.
- We didn't address _monotonic_ or _bounded_, and would probably vote to remove those words from the Outcome language.
