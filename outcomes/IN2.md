Hannah Burson: I would suggest 3 types of problems here. Each type would ask students to approximate the area under the curve of a function f(x) on [a,b] using some type of Riemann sum with n uniform subdivisions. But the function f(x) could be defined in three ways:
  - with an equation. Instructors can decide if they want students to sketch the graph and rectangles.
  - with a graph. This type will have to wait until images are supported
  - with a table of values.
  
  
I started an implementation of the equation version. The answers for the rational functions are very not nice, so that should be fixed. I think it will require restricting the number of possible functions there.
