Use definite integrals to find areas between two curves.

<!--![](.IN4.md.upload/paste-0.4453777468389619) -->

Edit: Abby - wrong screenshot here. A few sample problems:

Find the area of the following regions. Include the definite integral (with proper notation) and a sketch of the region with curves and important points labeled. \textbf{You may use the Desmos Area Between Curves visualizer linked in D2L.}


The region under the curve $y=\sqrt{x}$ from $x=0$ to $ x=4$. 

The region bounded by the graphs of $y=\frac{2}{x^3}$, $y=x$, $x=2$, and $x=4$. 

The region bounded by the graphs of $y=x^2-2x$ and $y=8$.

Hannah Burson and Laura Kinnel worked on this problem bank. We implemented one problem that will have a region bounded by a parabola and a line. There are comments in the sage file showing ideas for other possible regions we think should be implemented (and then the generator would randomly choose which set of equations to use).

We opted to leave out the most basic one, assuming there's very little thinking if if the student can do both IN1 and IN3.

We changed the instructions for the problems to "Set up, but do not evaluate," but our goal in the code is to ensure that the integrals are not hard to evaluate, so that the instructor could change the instruction to "Evaluate."
