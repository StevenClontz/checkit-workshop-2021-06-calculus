Define and use explicit and recursive formulas for sequences.

## June 9, 2021
Chrissy Safranski and Sarah Nelson worked on editing Tien's progress. Recursive formulas do not show up in our Calculus II courses. And proving the closed form using induction, definitely not.  So we are thinking that the objective should be different.

Possible change: Define and use sequences.

We feel like 1-3 together would make a more assess-ible objective. There seems to be too much going on with all five parts.
 
## Progress
- [x] For 1, use just one sequence, not all three
- [x] Move 3 to number 1 (and just one of them) (new part a)
- [x] Combine 1 and 2 into parts a and b of a second question. (parts b and c)
- [x] How to handle indices (but see below)



## Further Discussion/Changes
All of the sequences start at 0 in Sage, but Active Calculus defines a sequence as s_1, s_2, ... One option is to let students choose where to start and offer two different solutions (starting at 0 and starting at 1)

Currently, we give answers for starting with n=0 and n=1 for part a and say that answers may vary for part c, but only give n=0 as the answer.

Would it be ok to keep the recursion stuff there and just comment it out so instructors can add it as needed? - Tien

It seems like there are two different Learning Outcomes here... one that involves recursive sequences and one that doesn't. Not sure what to do about that.  Maybe make a different one, like SQ1a? -- Chrissy
